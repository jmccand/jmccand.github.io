I scanned his body using the Lidar sensor on a phone, used Fusion 360 to design a prototype, and 3D printed it out of flexible TPU filament.

Caesar ciphers are straightforward for a computer to solve, because there are only 25 possible shifts. After solving the Caesar ciphers, I wanted to write a program that would solve any substitution cipher, which is much more challenging because there are 26! = 2.092279e+13 possible substitution ciphers. The program works recursively by matching encrypted words to potential decryptions 1 word at a time, and seeing if the decryption key created works for the other words.

I iterated to find the correct balance between the ease of sliding the card in and out of the cover and the friction that holds the cards in.
